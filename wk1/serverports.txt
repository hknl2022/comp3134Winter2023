 - What is the definition of server port?
Web server ports are the logical endpoints of a network connection 
that is used to exchange information between a web server and a web client. 
These ports are assigned a unique number to identify them separately. 
Port 80 and 443 are the two standard ports used by web servers to communicate with the web clients.
 - What is server port range?
Port numbers can run from 0 to 65353. Port numbers from 0 to 1023 are reserved 
for common TCP/IP applications and are called well-known ports. 
The use of well-known ports allows client applications to easily locate 
the corresponding server application processes on other hosts.

 - How many bits does number above represent?
Whole numbers (integers) are usually represented with 4 bytes, 
or 32 bits. In the past, symbols (e.g., letters, digits) were represented 
with one byte (8 bits), with each symbol being mapped to a number between 0-255.
